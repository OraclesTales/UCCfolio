                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h5>Hi! My name is Uria.</h5>
                <p>I'm an Interaction Design student at George Brown and aspiring designer. I love to
                    express
                    myself and my interests through art and design. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
                <p>I started at George Brown in Fall of 2023. I chose the Interaction Design program because I saw the
                    variety of skills that would be taught within the program, and this interested me. I also thought
                    everything that would be taught in this program would prove useful in different industries. So far,
                    I've had ups and downs with the program, but overall, I'm happy with my learning. I've met tons of
                    wonderful people in this program, and most of our instructors have been kind, helpful, and caring.
                </p>

                <h2>My hobbies</h2>
                <p>I've never stuck to only one hobby, which is both a blessing and a curse. I have a handful of skills
                    that I can put my creativity into, but I can't say I'm an expert at it all. I've been in and out of
                    knitting, jewelry making, digital art, sketching, as well as reading and writing. I painted for some
                    time, but one of my high school courses killed the vibe for me. I'm hoping some day soon I'll pick
                    it up again when I'm in the right mindset. However, what fuels all of my hobbies, would be interests
                    that I'm passionate about. I have a huge love for DC, more specifically Batman and his family. One
                    day, I'll add a section to this site dedicated to all of my interests.</p>
